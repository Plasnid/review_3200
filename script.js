/**
 * * We had spent a lot of time with variables
 * * Variables are declared with either let or const
 * * Let and Const are part of ES6
 * *
 * * Earlier versions of JavaScript used var
 * * var is leaky, as it only stays inside of a function
 * * var is function scoped
 * * It can leak out of loops and get into code it shouldn't
 * * Avoid var.  Pretend var does not exist
 * 
 * * let and const are part of ES6
 * * They are block scoped, which means that any pair of {}
 * * will contain them!  They remain contently inside of functions
 * * loops, or any other use of braces!  Yaaay!
 * 
 *  * If you define a variable with let, you can change the value after you declare it
 *  * If you use const, once you set it, it stays set.  Const means constant!

/**
 * * Naming is a BIG deal in JavaScript!  Sometimes hours worth
 * * of meetings go into naming things!  
 * * Names in JavaScript can start with a letter or an underscore(_)
 * * 
 * * Some names are made of multiple words
 * * 
 * * Lets make a variable for a student name
 * * We can't call it "student name"..you can't have spaces in variable names
 * * There are 3 main ways of naming variables. 
 * * snake case: student_name
 * * camel case: studentName <----this one is my favourite!!
 * * kabob case: student-name
 * *
 * * For the purposes of our work in class, and for assignments please use camel case
 * * If you start a variable name with a letter, always make it start with lower case
 * 
 * * We use upperCase starting letters for classes only!  What is a class?  
 * * Explanation of classes coming later this semester!
